# Earthquakes App

This app uses the [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1) to display recent earthquakes on a map. It will collect the last 24 hours of earthquakes and display them on a map. It changes the map marker size based on the magnitude of the earthquake. Earthquakes under 3 are green, earthquakes between 3 and 5 are yellow and earthquakes over 5 are red.
