# Teach yourself Pester

## Abstract

In this beginner friendly follow-along, you will learn how to write Pester tests. We will start from existing code that has no tests. And we will end with code that is fully covered with tests, and built in CI/CD pipeline.

You will see the basic shapes of functions, and will write tests for them. You will write unit and integration tests. And you will ensure that you code coverage does not drop under 75%.

This practical lesson will arm you with knowledge that is easy to translate to real-life, and that will help you ship better and more reliable code.
