Will it meet the needs of its user? What role will the tool play in the PowerShell pipeline?  What do you need to consider in your tool design that will make your command easy to use and provide maximum benefit? In this session, you will learn about the human-side of PowerShell scripting as we explore how you should approach building a PowerShell tool with people in mind. Writing the code to achieve the task is relatively easy, but what do you need to know and consider to take your scripting projects to the next level?
